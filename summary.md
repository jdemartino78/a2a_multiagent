# Project Status & Next Steps

This document summarizes the current state of the multi-agent project and provides instructions for you to proceed.

## Current Status

I have successfully refactored the project to implement a secure, scalable, and low-latency multi-tenant architecture. The `host_agent` now acts as a central orchestrator that can route requests to both global and tenant-specific downstream agents.

### Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Implemented a registry-based discovery mechanism using a new `demo_agent_registry` service. Each tenant now gets their own `host_agent` instance, configured at startup with a `tenant_id`.

2.  **Security:** Implemented a complete OAuth 2.0 security flow.
    *   A new mock **Identity Provider (IDP)** (`idp`) handles user authentication and issues JWTs with a `tenant_id` claim.
    *   Downstream agents now validate these JWTs using a shared `token_validator.py`.
    *   The `host_agent` automatically initiates the login flow when a secure agent is accessed for the first time.

3.  **Tenant-Specific Agent:** Created a new, runnable `horizon_agent` to serve as a sample single-tenant service.

4.  **API Refactoring:** The `host_agent` now provides a simple Gradio chat interface for each tenant, removing the need for JSON input.

5.  **Agent Refactoring:** The `horizon_agent` was refactored to use the simple `google.adk.Agent` pattern, resolving a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

6.  **Documentation:** All relevant `README.md`, `spec.md`, and `summary.md` files have been updated to reflect the new architecture.

## Your Next Steps

Here is a clear, actionable guide for you to run the complete system.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

If you have not already, you must install the project's dependencies. This is a **critical step** to resolve any potential `ModuleNotFoundError` issues. Run this command from the project root directory:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Step 2: Run All Services and Agents

To run the system, you must start all the services and agents in the following order. Open a separate terminal for each of the following commands and run them from the project root directory.

**Terminal 1: Start the Identity Provider (IDP)**
```bash
python -m idp.app
```

**Terminal 2: Start the Demo Agent Registry**
```bash
python -m demo_agent_registry.app
```

**Terminal 3: Start the Weather Agent**
```bash
python -m weather_agent
```

**Terminal 4: Start the Calendar Agent**
```bash
python -m calendar_agent
```

**Terminal 5: Start the Horizon Agent for Tenant 'tenant-abc'**
```bash
python -m horizon_agent --port 10008 --tenant-id tenant-abc
```

**Terminal 6: Start the Airbnb Agent**
```bash
python -m airbnb_agent
```

**Terminal 7: Start the Host Agent**
```bash
python -m host_agent --port 8083 --tenant-id tenant-abc
```

### Step 3: Interact with the System

Once all agents are running, you can interact with the system via the Gradio UI for the host agent.

*   Open your browser to **http://localhost:8083**

Now, try to access a secure agent. For example, ask:

```
What is the status of my order 123?
```

Since this is the first time you are accessing the `horizon_agent` for `tenant-abc`, the `host_agent` will initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow. You will be redirected to the IDP to log in. After you log in, you will be redirected back to the host agent, and your request will be automatically resumed and processed.
