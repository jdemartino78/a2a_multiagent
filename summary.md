# Project Status & Next Steps

This document summarizes the current state of the multi-agent project and provides instructions for you to proceed.

## Current Status

I have successfully refactored the project to implement a secure, scalable, and low-latency multi-tenant architecture. The `host_agent` now acts as a central orchestrator that can route requests to both global and tenant-specific downstream agents.

### Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Implemented a registry-based discovery mechanism using `host_agent/agent_registry.json`. Each tenant now gets their own `host_agent` instance, configured at startup with a `tenant_id`.

2.  **Tenant-Specific Agent:** Created a new, runnable `horizon_agent` to serve as a sample single-tenant service.

3.  **API Refactoring:** The `host_agent` now provides a simple Gradio chat interface for each tenant, removing the need for JSON input.

4.  **Agent Refactoring:** The `horizon_agent` was refactored to use the simple `google.adk.Agent` pattern, resolving a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

5.  **Documentation:** All relevant `README.md`, `spec.md`, and `summary.md` files have been updated to reflect the new architecture.

## Your Next Steps

Here is a clear, actionable guide for you to run the complete system.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

If you have not already, you must install the project's dependencies. This is a **critical step** to resolve any potential `ModuleNotFoundError` issues. Run this command from the project root directory:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Step 2: Run All Agents

Open seven separate terminals. In each terminal, from the project root directory, run one of the following commands. It is important to run each agent in its own terminal to see its logs.

**Terminal 1: Start the Weather Agent**
```bash
python -m weather_agent
```

**Terminal 2: Start the Calendar Agent**
```bash
python -m calendar_agent
```

**Terminal 3: Start the Horizon Agent for Tenant 'tenant-abc'**
```bash
python -m horizon_agent --port 10008
```

**Terminal 4: Start the Horizon Agent for Tenant 'tenant-xyz'**
```bash
python -m horizon_agent --port 10009
```

**Terminal 5: Start the Airbnb Agent**
```bash
python -m airbnb_agent
```

**Terminal 6: Start the Host Agent for Tenant 'tenant-abc'**
```bash
python -m host_agent --port 8083 --tenant-id tenant-abc
```

**Terminal 7: Start the Host Agent for Tenant 'tenant-xyz'**
```bash
python -m host_agent --port 8084 --tenant-id tenant-xyz
```

### Step 3: Interact with the System

Once all agents are running, you can interact with the system via the Gradio UI for each tenant.

*   **For Tenant 'tenant-abc'**: Open your browser to **http://localhost:8083**
*   **For Tenant 'tenant-xyz'**: Open your browser to **http://localhost:8084**

You can now chat directly with the host agent for that tenant. For example, if you are on the UI for `tenant-abc`, you can ask:

```
What is the status of my order 123?
```

The host agent will automatically route your request to the correct `horizon_agent` for `tenant-abc`.
